​The Economic Simulation Library provides an extensive collection of tools to develop, test, analyse and calibrate economic and financial models. The library is designed to take advantage of different computer architectures. In order to facilitate rapid iteration during model development the library can use parallel computation. Economic models developed using the library can be deployed into large-scale distributed computing environments when working with large model instances and datasets and provides routines to set up large-scale sampling computations during the analysis and calibration process.
